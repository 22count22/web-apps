## Lesson Plan

> [Lesson Plan Slides](https://hackyourfuture.be/module-name/week-X)

* Command line arguments: `argsv`
* Native Node.js modules: `fs`, `assert`

### Isolate

* `assert`: [examples](../isolate/assert). (no `assert` exercises, the `fs` exercises use `assert`)
* `fs`: [examples](../isolate/fs-examples), [exercises](../isolate/fs-exercises)

### Integrate

* [weather-it](../integrate/weather-it)
* [json-todo-cli](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/coming-soon) (starter repo)

## Assignments

> Before getting started on the homework, take a minute to set up your [Homework Issue](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission#homework-issues) on this module's project board.

### Exercises

#### Isolating JavaScript

* [request-module](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/request-module)
  * Practice making http requests from Node
  * `request` is the Node.js equivalent of `fetch` in the browser

#### Integrating JavaScript

* [cowsaydex](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/cowsaydex)
  * Practice integrating NPM Packages into your projects, starting with [cowsay](https://github.com/piuccio/cowsay)
  * There is an obfuscated demo and a completed `development-strategy.md`.  Make it work!

### Project

#### `api-deep-freeze`

> [project type](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission/#projects)

This week's project is to fork and complete the [`api-deep-freeze` repository](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/api-deep-freeze).  This is a 'simple' node script that fetches data from an API and saves it locally.

You will be expected to turn in your code from his tutorial on a new repository called `api-deep-freeze`.  This should be a complete project repository including:

* A `development-strategy.md` file to explain how you built the app in small pieces (this file doesn't need to match the tutorial!)
* One branch per step in your `development-strategy.md`
* _something about how to organize the code_
* _any more requirements_

You will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, the correctness of your branches, the organization of your code, and the completeness of your README.

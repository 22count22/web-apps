## Before this Module

In the previous module ([asynchronous-programming](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/asynchronous-programming), 3 weeks) students learned how the event loop works, how to use callbacks and schedule with `setTimeout`/`setInterval`, how to write promises and `async`/`await`, and use `fetch`.

In the second two weeks of Async Programming students learned about the restful convention and built static projects that consume data from RESTful APIs.

## After this Module

In the next module ([databases](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/databases), 2 weeks) students will learn how to query SQL databases and build a RESTful API around a database. They will use SQLite to side-step the technical challenges of hosting a three-tier application, that will be covered in the final project.

The project will be an open-ended two-week project where students are given a database and left to design/develop the rest as a team.
